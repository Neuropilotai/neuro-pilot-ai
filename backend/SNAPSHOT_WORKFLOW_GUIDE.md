# Inventory Snapshot & Flexible Reporting Guide

**Purpose**: Create inventory snapshots (baselines) and generate flexible reports by adding/removing specific orders

---

## 🎯 The Concept

### Problem You Want to Solve:
> "After I create a report, THEN I can use the invoices I want. Use the inventory count and include or remove orders before or after the last inventory count."

### Solution: **Snapshot System**

1. **Take an inventory count** → Creates a snapshot/baseline
2. **Snapshot becomes your starting point** → Known inventory at specific date
3. **Create reports from snapshot** → Add or remove specific orders as needed
4. **Flexible reporting** → Same snapshot, different reports by including different orders

---

## 📊 Real-World Example

### Your July Count:

#### Step 1: Count Inventory (July 31)
```
You count: $580,000
Last invoice included: July 28, 2025
```

#### Step 2: Create Snapshot
```
Snapshot Name: "July 2025 Month-End"
Baseline: $580,000 (what you counted)
Cut-off: July 28, 2025
```

#### Step 3: Generate Different Reports

**Report A - July Only:**
- Start with snapshot: $580,000
- Add orders: None
- **Total: $580,000** (pure July count)

**Report B - July + Some August:**
- Start with snapshot: $580,000
- Add orders: Aug 1, Aug 5, Aug 10
- **Total: $625,000** (July + selected August)

**Report C - July + All August:**
- Start with snapshot: $580,000
- Add all orders after July 28
- **Total: $859,000** (complete current inventory)

**Report D - Remove Some July:**
- Start with snapshot: $580,000
- Remove orders that arrived late
- **Total: $570,000** (adjusted July)

## 📋 Complete Workflow

### Part 1: Create Your First Snapshot

#### 1. Complete Inventory Count
```bash
# Set cut-off date
node prepare_cutoff_inventory.js
# Enter: 2025-07-28

# Lock orders after cut-off
node lock_orders_after_cutoff.js

# Export count sheet
node export_count_sheet.js

# Do physical count (you do this manually)

# Import counts
node import_inventory_count.js data/inventory_counts/[your_file].csv
```

#### 2. Create Snapshot from Count
```bash
node create_inventory_snapshot.js
```

**What it asks:**
- Count date: `2025-07-31` (when you counted)
- Snapshot name: `July 2025 Month-End`
- Notes: `Physical count completed, variance -$70K`
- Your name: `David`

**What it saves:**
- Counted value: $580,000
- Expected value: $650,000
- Variance: -$70,000
- Last included invoice: 9024785494
- Cut-off date: 2025-07-28
- All item-level details

### Part 2: Generate Reports from Snapshot

#### Report #1: Current Inventory (July + August + September)

```bash
node report_from_snapshot.js
```

**Process:**
```
📸 Available Snapshots:
1. July 2025 Month-End
   Date: 2025-07-31 | Cut-off: 2025-07-28
   Value: $580,000

Choose snapshot: 1

📦 Orders Received AFTER Baseline (2025-07-28):
Date       | Invoice     | Note       | Value     | Include?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2025-07-29 | 9024785490 | BEN 3-4    | $12,450   | y
2025-07-30 | 9024785491 |            | $15,320   | y
2025-08-01 | 9025025278 | AIR INUIT  | $18,750   | y
... (continue for all orders)

📊 FINAL INVENTORY VALUE
Baseline (counted):  $580,000
Added orders:        $279,333
──────────────────────────────
TOTAL:               $859,333
```

**Result:** Complete current inventory

---

#### Report #2: July + August Only

```bash
node report_from_snapshot.js
```

**Process:**
```
Choose snapshot: 1 (July 2025 Month-End)

📦 Orders Received AFTER Baseline:
2025-07-29 | 9024785490 | BEN 3-4    | $12,450 | y ← Yes
2025-07-30 | 9024785491 |            | $15,320 | y ← Yes
2025-08-01 | 9025025278 | AIR INUIT  | $18,750 | y ← Yes
... (all August orders: yes)
2025-09-01 | 9026294223 |            | $14,200 | n ← No
2025-09-05 | 9026294224 |            | $16,500 | n ← No
... (all September orders: no)

📊 FINAL INVENTORY VALUE
Baseline (counted):  $580,000
Added orders:        $145,000 (August only)
──────────────────────────────
TOTAL:               $725,000
```

**Result:** July + August inventory

---

#### Report #3: Just the Count (July Only)

```bash
node report_from_snapshot.js
```

**Process:**
```
Choose snapshot: 1

📦 Orders Received AFTER Baseline:
2025-07-29 | 9024785490 | ... | n ← No to all
2025-07-30 | 9024785491 | ... | n
... (say no to everything)

📊 FINAL INVENTORY VALUE
Baseline (counted):  $580,000
Added orders:        $0
──────────────────────────────
TOTAL:               $580,000
```

**Result:** Pure July count

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Monthly Reports
```
January Count → Snapshot
February Count → Snapshot
March Count → Snapshot

For Q1 Report:
- Start with January snapshot
- Add all February orders
- Add all March orders
= Q1 Total
```

### Use Case 2: Variance Analysis
```
July Count: $580,000
August Count: $625,000

Difference: $45,000

Why? Generate report from July snapshot adding August orders
Shows exactly what came in August
```

### Use Case 3: Audit Compliance
```
Auditor asks: "What was inventory on July 31?"

Answer:
- View July snapshot: $580,000
- Plus pending orders (if they ask for current): +$279K
- Total current: $859K
```

### Use Case 4: Flexible Period Reporting
```
Need inventory for "First 2 weeks of August":

- Start with July snapshot
- Add orders Aug 1-14 only
- Exclude orders Aug 15-31
= First half August inventory
```

## 📊 Snapshot vs. Locked Orders

### They Work Together!

**Locked Orders** (Short-term):
- Lock orders during counting
- Prevents them from appearing in count
- Unlock after count complete

**Snapshots** (Long-term):
- Permanent record of count
- Baseline for future reports
- Never changes

### Combined Workflow:
```
1. Lock orders after July 28
2. Export count sheet (July only)
3. Count inventory
4. Import counts
5. CREATE SNAPSHOT ← Saves baseline
6. Unlock August orders
7. Generate reports from snapshot
   - Add back August orders as needed
```
