1. **Deploy to Railway** ✈️
2. **Create Stripe products** 💳
3. **Update all platforms** 🔄
4. **Monitor & sync everything** 👁️

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /Users/davidmikulis/neuro-pilot-ai
npm install node-fetch uuid
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Create or update your `.env` file:

```bash
# Required for Stripe automation
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key_here

# Optional for email automation
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# Optional for Railway CLI automation
RAILWAY_TOKEN=your_railway_token_here
```

### 3. Start the Super Agent Ecosystem

```bash
# Start all super agents at once
node start_super_agent_ecosystem.js
```

Or start individually:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Enhanced Super Agent
cd backend && node enhanced_super_agent.js

# Terminal 2: Platform Integration Super Agent
cd backend && node platform_integration_super_agent.js

# Terminal 3: Real Business Dashboard
cd backend && node real_business_dashboard.js
```

## 🎯 How Auto-Deployment Works

### The Flow:

1. **Create gig** in dashboard → Testing phase
2. **Run tests** until scores >80%
3. **Click "Approve & Launch"** → **MAGIC HAPPENS**
4. Super agents automatically:
   - Deploy to Railway
   - Create Stripe products
   - Update dashboard status
   - Sync all platforms
5. **Your gig is live** across all platforms!

### What the User Sees:

```
🚀 Are you sure you want to approve and AUTO-DEPLOY this gig to all platforms?

✅ This will:
• Deploy to Railway

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Super agents not connecting:**

```bash
# Check if all ports are available
lsof -i :3010
lsof -i :9000
lsof -i :9001

# Restart the ecosystem
node start_super_agent_ecosystem.js
```

**Stripe automation not working:**

```bash
# Check environment variable
echo $STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

# Test Stripe connection
node -e "console.log(require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY).apiVersion)"
```

**Railway deployment fails:**

```bash
# Check Railway CLI
railway --version

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Check project status
railway status
```

### Health Checks

The ecosystem automatically:

- ✅ Monitors all agents every 30 seconds
- ✅ Restarts failed agents automatically
- ✅ Generates status reports every 5 minutes
- ✅ Handles graceful shutdown on system signals
