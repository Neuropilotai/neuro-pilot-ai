# Duplicate Prevention Integration - Complete

## Overview

Duplicate prevention has been fully integrated into all invoice processing pathways to ensure no duplicate PDF orders are added to inventory.

## System Components

### 1. **DuplicatePreventionSystem** (`duplicate_prevention_system.js`)

Complete multi-layer duplicate detection system:

#### Detection Methods:
1. **Invoice Number** - Ensures unique invoice numbers (database constraint)
2. **File Hash (SHA-256)** - Detects identical PDF files even if renamed
3. **Content Fingerprint (MD5)** - Detects re-scans with slightly different files
4. **Date + Amount Match** - Catches manual re-entry with same date and total (within $0.01 tolerance)

#### Key Features:
- Tracks all processed invoices in `processed_invoices` table
- Logs duplicate attempts in `duplicate_attempts` table
- Provides statistics on historical duplicate attempts
- Can scan directories before processing

### 2. **Integration Points**

#### A. Enterprise Inventory Manager (`enterprise_inventory_manager.js`)

**Changes:**
- Added `DuplicatePreventionSystem` initialization in constructor
- Modified `importInvoicesFromJSON()` to check duplicates before importing
- Added duplicate stats tracking (invoicesImported, duplicatesSkipped)
- Added helper methods:
  - `getDuplicateStats()` - Get duplicate prevention statistics
  - `scanForDuplicates(pdfDir)` - Scan directory for duplicates
- Updated `close()` to close duplicate system

**Import Workflow:**
```javascript
1. Check if invoice is duplicate (invoice number, file hash)
2. If duplicate → Skip and log attempt
3. If not duplicate → Import items
4. Mark invoice as processed
```

#### B. PDF Extractor (`flawless_pdf_extractor.js`)

**Changes:**
- Added duplicate prevention system initialization
- Checks for duplicates BEFORE extracting PDF data (saves processing time)
- Checks again AFTER extraction using content fingerprint
- Marks successfully processed invoices
- Reports duplicates in extraction statistics

**Extraction Workflow:**
```javascript
1. Check for duplicate by invoice number/file hash
2. If duplicate → Skip extraction entirely
3. If not duplicate → Extract PDF data
4. Check for duplicate by content fingerprint
5. If duplicate → Skip saving
6. If not duplicate → Save JSON and mark as processed
```

#### C. API Endpoints (`routes/enterprise-inventory-api.js`)

**New Endpoints:**

```
GET  /api/enterprise-inventory/duplicates/stats
     - Get duplicate prevention statistics
     - Returns: total attempts, by type, last attempt date

POST /api/enterprise-inventory/duplicates/scan
     - Scan directory for duplicates before processing
     - Body: { pdfDir } (optional)
     - Returns: total, new, duplicates, duplicate list
```

**Updated Endpoints:**

```
POST /api/enterprise-inventory/import-invoices
     - Now includes duplicate prevention
     - Returns: files, items, invoicesImported, duplicatesSkipped

GET  /api/enterprise-inventory/dashboard
     - Now includes duplicatesBlocked count
```

## Database Schema

### Tables Created:

#### `processed_invoices`
Tracks all successfully processed invoices:
- invoice_number (UNIQUE)
- pdf_file_hash (UNIQUE) - SHA-256 hash
- content_fingerprint - MD5 hash of invoice data
- invoice_date, total_amount, item_count
- processed_at, processed_by

#### `duplicate_attempts`
Logs all duplicate detection attempts:
- invoice_number, pdf_file_path, pdf_file_hash
- duplicate_type (INVOICE_NUMBER, FILE_HASH, CONTENT_FINGERPRINT, DATE_AMOUNT)
- matched_invoice_id (foreign key)
- attempted_at, attempted_by
- action_taken (REJECTED, SKIPPED, MERGED)

### Indexes:
- invoice_number, pdf_file_hash, content_fingerprint
- date + amount composite index
- duplicate attempt tracking indexes

## Usage Examples

### CLI Scan for Duplicates

```bash
# Run standalone duplicate scan
node duplicate_prevention_system.js

# Output shows:
# - Total PDFs found
# - New/Unique PDFs
# - Duplicate PDFs (with type and reason)
# - Historical duplicate attempt statistics
```

### Import with Duplicate Prevention

```bash
# Automatically enabled when importing
node setup-enterprise-inventory.js

# Or via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/enterprise-inventory/import-invoices
```

### Extract PDFs with Duplicate Prevention

```bash
# Automatically enabled when extracting
node flawless_pdf_extractor.js

# Reports will show:
# - Successfully extracted
# - Duplicates skipped
# - Failed extractions
```

## Statistics & Monitoring

### Get Duplicate Stats via API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/enterprise-inventory/duplicates/stats
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "stats": {
    "total_attempts": 15,
    "unique_invoices": 10,
    "by_number": 8,
    "by_file_hash": 5,
    "by_content": 2,
    "by_date_amount": 0,
    "last_attempt": "2025-01-15 10:30:45"
  }
}
```

### Dashboard Statistics:

The dashboard now includes `duplicatesBlocked` count showing total duplicate attempts prevented.

## Benefits

✅ **Prevents Double-Counting** - No duplicate invoices in inventory
✅ **Multiple Detection Layers** - Catches duplicates even if renamed or re-scanned
✅ **Automatic Logging** - Full audit trail of duplicate attempts
✅ **Performance Optimization** - Skips extraction for known duplicates
✅ **Transparent Reporting** - Clear statistics on what was prevented
✅ **Enterprise-Grade** - Professional duplicate prevention system

## Testing

To test the duplicate prevention:

1. **Download a new invoice** from GFS and place in `data/invoices/`
2. **Process it once** - Should succeed
3. **Process it again** - Should be detected as duplicate
4. **Rename the file** - Still detected via file hash
5. **Re-scan the PDF** (slightly different file) - Detected via content fingerprint
6. **Check stats** - View duplicate attempt logs

## Next Steps

The only remaining Phase 1 task is:
- **Build UI for location assignment workflow** (frontend development)

All backend systems are complete and production-ready with:
- ✅ Database schema
- ✅ Invoice status tracking
- ✅ Location assignment API
- ✅ Physical count management
- ✅ Cut-off date logic
- ✅ Min/max inventory levels
- ✅ **Duplicate prevention** ← COMPLETED

## Files Modified

1. `/backend/enterprise_inventory_manager.js` - Added duplicate checking to import
2. `/backend/flawless_pdf_extractor.js` - Added duplicate checking to extraction
3. `/backend/routes/enterprise-inventory-api.js` - Added duplicate endpoints
4. `/backend/duplicate_prevention_system.js` - Core system (already created)

## System Ready

The duplicate prevention system is now fully integrated and active. Any invoice processing through:
- PDF extraction
- JSON import
- API endpoints

Will automatically check for and prevent duplicates before adding to inventory.
