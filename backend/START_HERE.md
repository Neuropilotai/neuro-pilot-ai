## 🎯 What You're About to Do

You're about to perform your **first physical inventory count** with your new enterprise system. This will:

1. Give you an accurate picture of what you actually have
2. Show you where items are being used/consumed
3. Establish a baseline for future tracking
4. Enable month-end reporting with GL codes

**Time Required**: 2-4 hours (depending on team size)

---

## 📋 Quick Start (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Prepare the System (2 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/davidmikulis/neuro-pilot-ai/backend
node prepare_first_inventory.js
```

**What this does**: Marks all items as ready to count

---

### Step 2: Export Your Count Sheet (1 minute)
```bash
node export_count_sheet.js
```

**Output**: `data/inventory_counts/inventory_count_sheet_2025-10-04.csv`

**What to do**:
- Open in Excel or Google Sheets
- Print it (or use on tablet)

---

### Step 3: Count Your Inventory (2-4 hours)

Walk through your storage and count items:

**Count Sheet Columns**:
- `GL_Code` - Category (MILK, MEAT, etc.)
- `Item_Code` - GFS item number
- `Description` - What it is
- `Unit` - Usually "CS" for cases
- `Expected_Cases` - What system thinks you have
- `Expected_Value` - Dollar value
- **`Counted_Cases`** ← **YOU FILL THIS IN**
- **`Notes`** ← **Note any issues**

**Tips**:
- Count in cases (2.5 for partial cases)
- Work by category (all MILK, then all MEAT, etc.)
- Note expired/damaged items
- Double-check high-value items

---

### Step 4: Import Your Counts (2 minutes)

Save your count sheet as: `inventory_count_sheet_2025-10-04_COUNTED.csv`

```bash
node import_inventory_count.js data/inventory_counts/inventory_count_sheet_2025-10-04_COUNTED.csv
```

**What this does**: Imports your counts and calculates differences

---

### Step 5: Review Results (5 minutes)
```bash
node inventory_variance_report.js
```

**What you'll see**:
- Items that matched perfectly
- Items with more than expected (over-counts)
- Items with less than expected (under-counts)
- Total variance (difference in $)

### Typical First Count Results

**Don't be surprised if**:
- Your actual inventory is 60-80% of expected ($550K-$750K)
- This is normal! It means you've used $150K-$350K worth
- First counts often show 15-25% variance
- Perishables (PROD, MILK) will have higher variance

**What's Normal**:
- PROD/MILK/MEAT: 50-70% of expected (high turnover)
- DRY GOODS: 80-90% of expected (slower turnover)
- PAPER/CLEAN: 70-85% of expected (steady usage)

## 🎯 After Your Count

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Review High Variances** (>$100 per item)
   - Investigate why
   - Document findings
   - Recount if needed

2. **Document Known Issues**
   - Spoilage/waste
   - Items in use
   - Storage location issues

3. **Set Baselines**
   - This becomes your starting point
   - Future counts will be more accurate

### Next Week:

1. **Spot Check Count** - Recount 10-20 high-value items
2. **Process New Invoices** - Let auto-sync work
3. **Compare Trends** - See how variance changes

## 📞 Need Help?

### Common Questions:

**Q: Item not on count sheet?**
A: It might be from before January or non-GFS supplier. Add manually with notes.

**Q: Can't find an item?**
A: Search all locations (freezer, cooler, dry storage, kitchen, dining). Mark as 0 if truly not found.

**Q: Variance seems huge?**
A: Normal for first count! This is 9 months of usage since January. You've likely consumed $150K-$350K.
