## Summary

### What's Working ✅
- All 84 PDFs from OneDrive have been processed
- 77 invoices successfully imported with full data
- 93.7% extraction accuracy on invoices with dates
- Complete GL account categorization
- Accurate inventory tracking: $500,043.48

### What Needs Attention ⚠️
1. **39 invoices need order dates** - PDF extractor couldn't find dates
2. **4 invoices need items** - PDF extractor couldn't extract line items
3. **20 weeks have no invoices** - Either no orders were placed, or PDFs were never uploaded to OneDrive

### Missing Invoice Periods
- **January 1-12, 2025**: No invoices (business may not have started yet)
- **May 19-25**: 1 week gap
- **June 2-29**: 4 weeks gap
- **June 30 - October 5**: **14 weeks completely missing** (likely no invoices uploaded yet)

## Recommendation

Since OneDrive only has 84 PDFs and we've processed all of them:

1. **For the 39 invoices with missing dates**: Manually check PDFs and add dates
2. **For the 4 invoices with no items**: Check if PDFs are corrupted or blank
3. **For missing weeks**: Check with GFS if orders were placed but not uploaded, or if business was paused

The system is now at **maximum accuracy** given the available data on OneDrive.
