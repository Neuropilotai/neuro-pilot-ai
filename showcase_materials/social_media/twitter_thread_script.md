## 🧵 THREAD 2: ATS Problem Solution
1/6 🧵 Why 90% of resumes never reach human eyes (and how to fix it)

2/6 The problem: ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) filter out resumes that don't match specific criteria
• Wrong keywords
• Poor formatting

✅ Uses industry-specific keywords
✅ Ensures ATS compatibility

5/6 Result: 95% ATS pass rate vs 10% for generic templates
