## 🎯 POST 1: Success Story
**Caption:**
🤖 AI just helped someone go from McDonald's crew member to landing interviews at tech companies.

Here's what our AI changed:
❌ Before: "Good with people and computers"
✅ After: "Customer relationship management with 98% satisfaction ratings"

❌ Before: "Worked at McDonald's"  
✅ After: "Managed high-volume customer operations serving 200+ daily"

The magic? Our AI adapts content based on the target job. Same person, same experience - completely different presentation.

90% of resumes get rejected by ATS systems. Don't let yours be one of them.

## 🎯 POST 2: Problem/Solution
**Caption:**
Why do 90% of resumes get rejected before a human even sees them?

❌ ATS systems filter out generic templates
❌ Keywords don't match job descriptions  
❌ Formatting breaks parsing algorithms
❌ Content doesn't address specific requirements

Our AI solves this by:
✅ Analyzing each job description individually
✅ Adapting content from entry-level to executive tone
✅ Using industry-specific keywords automatically
✅ Ensuring ATS compatibility

Ready to stop getting filtered out? 

Comment "RESUME" and I'll share how our AI can help.
