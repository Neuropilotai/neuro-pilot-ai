## 🎯 PENDING: UNLOCK FULL AUTONOMY

### **Critical Blockers** 🔴
1. **No inventory snapshots yet**
   - Impact: All stock levels = 0 (using par_level estimates)
   - Solution: Take first physical count
   - Result: Real stock-out risk calculation

2. **No actual usage logging**
   - Impact: Cannot calculate forecast accuracy
   - Solution: Log today's consumption by end of day
   - Result: Anomaly detection enabled, learning loop activated

### **Next Steps** 🟡
3. Import 4-week rotating menu into menu_calendar
4. Enable contractor coffee requisition split tracking
5. Set up dorm-specific cleaning supply forecasting (5 dorms)
6. Add real vegetables to Jigg Dinner (cabbage, carrots, turnips)
7. Track sandwich program actual production vs 500 baseline

## 💡 INTELLIGENT QUESTIONS (Learning Queue)

### **Rotation Schedule**
❓ During your off-rotation weeks (Week 3 & 4), does population change?
❓ Who manages forecasting when you're off? Should I generate autonomous reports?

### **Contractor Split**
❓ Do contractor groups requisition coffee in smaller bags vs cafeteria bulk?
❓ Should I track contractor usage separately from cafeteria?

### **Dorm Operations**
❓ Are cleaning chemicals tracked per dorm (5 dorms)?
❓ Is Dorm 3 usage actually higher, or was that an estimate?

### **Sandwich Program**
❓ Is 500/day accurate, or should I adjust based on waste patterns?
❓ Do Sundays with Jigg Dinner affect sandwich demand?
