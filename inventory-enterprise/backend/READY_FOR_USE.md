## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES TO ADDRESS

From the Pre-Count Readiness Audit:

### 🔴 High Priority
1. **Foreign Keys Disabled**
   - Status: Deferred (functional without)
   - Impact: Data integrity checks disabled
   - Fix: Run `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`

2. **No Backup System**
   - Status: ⚠️ Critical
   - Impact: No disaster recovery
   - Fix: See backup instructions below

3. **AI Ops Not Running**
   - Status: Optional
   - Impact: No anomaly detection
   - Fix: Not required for first count

### ✅ Backup Instructions (RECOMMENDED)

Create manual backup before first count:

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd /Users/davidmikulis/neuro-pilot-ai/inventory-enterprise/backend

# Create backup
cp database.db database_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).db

# Verify backup
ls -lh database_backup_*.db
```

**Recommendation:** Create backup BEFORE and AFTER first inventory count.
