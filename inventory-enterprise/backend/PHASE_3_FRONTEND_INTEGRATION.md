## 🎯 Next Steps

### Optional Enhancements

1. **Add Role-Based Visibility**
   - Only show Phase 3 nav items to owner/admin users
   - Add conditional rendering in DashboardLayout.jsx

2. **Add Notification Badges**
   - Show count of pending proposals on "AI Learning" nav item
   - Show high-risk alert badge on "System Health" if risk > 60%

3. **Add Page-Level Access Control**
   - Redirect non-owner users if they try to access Phase 3 URLs directly
   - Show "Access Denied" message instead of 403 API errors

4. **Customize MUI Theme**
   - Match Material-UI theme colors to Tailwind design system
   - Ensure dark mode consistency

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Components not rendering
**Solution:** Ensure Material-UI dependencies are installed:
```bash
cd ~/neuro-pilot-ai/inventory-enterprise/frontend/dashboard
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material react-markdown
```

### Issue: API calls failing
**Solution:** Verify backend server is running:
```bash
cd ~/neuro-pilot-ai/inventory-enterprise/backend
PORT=8083 node server.js
```

Check console for Phase 3 initialization message:
```
✨ Phase 3 Autonomous Learning ACTIVE
```

### Issue: "Access denied" errors
**Solution:** Ensure you're logged in as owner:
1. Check email in localStorage: `localStorage.getItem('authToken')`
2. Decode JWT to verify email
3. Logout and login again with `neuro.pilot.ai@gmail.com`
