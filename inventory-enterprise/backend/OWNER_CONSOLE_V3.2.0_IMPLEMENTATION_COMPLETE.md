# Owner Super Console v3.2.0 - Implementation Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Version**: 3.2.0
**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

## Executive Summary

Successfully extended the Owner Super Console with four major feature sets:

1. **One-Command Start & Orchestration** - System-wide service management
2. **Tiered Reporting Center** - Role-based reports (9th tab with 5 sub-sections)

### Startup Sequence (5 Steps)
1. **Health Check** - Verify system is operational
2. **Localhost Bind Validation** - Confirm 127.0.0.1 binding
3. **Warm Forecast Cache** - Pre-load today + tomorrow predictions
4. **Rotate Keys (if due)** - Check and rotate Ed25519 keypairs

## 💾 Feature Set C: Backup & Recovery Kit

### Backend Routes Created
- **File**: `routes/owner-recovery.js`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/owner/recovery/backup` - Create encrypted recovery kit
  - `POST /api/owner/recovery/verify` - Verify kit integrity
  - `POST /api/owner/recovery/restore` - Dry-run restore simulation

### Recovery Kit Structure
```
recovery_kit_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.tar.gz.enc
├── database.db          (SQLite database copy)
├── keys.json           (Quantum public keys export)

- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with SHA-256 (100,000 iterations)
- **Salt**: 32 bytes random
- **IV**: 16 bytes random
- **Auth Tag**: 16 bytes for integrity verification
- **Passphrase**: Min 12 characters required
- **File Format**: `salt(32) + iv(16) + authTag(16) + encrypted_data`

### Integrity Verification
- **SHA-256 Checksums** for:
  - Database file
  - Keys file
  - Final encrypted tarball
- **Manifest** includes:
  - Creation timestamp
  - Creator email
  - File sizes
  - Expected checksums
  - System version (3.2.0)

### Restore Dry-Run
6-step restore plan preview (no actual changes):

## 🧠 Feature Set D: AI Learning Nudge Panel

### Backend Integration
- Uses **existing feedback endpoint**: `POST /api/owner/forecast/comment`
- Uses **existing training endpoint**: `POST /api/owner/forecast/train`
- Source tag: `learning_nudge` for differentiation

### Frontend Implementation
- **Location**: AI Console tab → new "AI Learning Nudge" card
- **Sample Nudges** (3 intelligent suggestions):
  1. **Coffee consumption split** - "Do contractors drink coffee at the same rate as residents?"
  2. **Weekend patterns** - "Does weekend consumption differ from weekdays?"
  3. **Seasonal items** - "Have you noticed seasonal trends in produce consumption?"

### User Workflow
1. **View Nudge** - AI-generated question with suggested insight placeholder
2. **Enter Observation** - Type natural language insight (e.g., "contractors coffee 0.8 cups per person")
3. **Record** - Save to pending feedback list
4. **Train** - Apply immediately (combo: record + train in one click)

### UI Components
- **Input Field** per nudge with placeholder suggestion
- **Two Buttons**:
  - **Record** (blue) - Save for later training
  - **Train** (green) - Save + train immediately
- **Info Footer** - Explains the learning opportunity concept

### Integration with Existing Feedback System
- All nudge insights flow through the same feedback pipeline
- Appears in **Feedback History** with `source: learning_nudge`
- Can be trained via **Train Now** button or inline **Train** button
- Updates AI confidence scores in real-time

- **Stop All**: Safe shutdown before maintenance (doesn't stop main server)
- **Status**: Quick health check of optional services

**Tip**: Run "Start All" monthly to rotate keys and warm cache

### Recovery
**Use Case**: Disaster recovery and audit compliance
- **Create Kit**: Monthly USB backup with encryption
- **Verify Kit**: Quarterly integrity check
- **Dry-Run Restore**: Annual disaster recovery drill

**Tip**: Store USB kit off-site, test passphrase recovery process quarterly

### AI Learning Nudge
**Use Case**: Continuous learning improvement
- **Review Nudges**: Check weekly for new AI questions
- **Record Insights**: Document observations as you notice patterns
- **Train Immediately**: Use green "Train" button for urgent updates

**Tip**: Use nudges during monthly reviews to capture seasonal trends

## 🔧 Maintenance & Operations

### Monitoring
**Key Metrics**:
- Orchestration success rate (audit logs)
- Recovery kit creation frequency
- Report load times (should stay <300ms)
- Learning nudge engagement (feedback submissions)

**Alert Thresholds**:
- Orchestration start failures >1/day
- Report load time >500ms sustained
- Recovery kit creation failures
- AI training failures >10%

### Backup Schedule
**Recommended**:
- **Daily**: Automatic SQLite backup (existing)
- **Weekly**: Test orchestration start/stop
- **Monthly**: Create recovery kit to USB
- **Quarterly**: Verify recovery kit integrity
- **Annually**: Full dry-run restore drill

### Log Rotation
**New Log Sources**:
- `owner_console_events` table (orchestration, recovery audit)
- Archived monthly (recommended)

---

## 📝 Known Limitations (By Design)

1. **Recovery Restore from Console**: Only dry-run allowed (safety by design)
   - Full restore requires manual server access
   - Prevents accidental data loss

2. **Reports Data Lag**: Real-time data within 1min
   - Uses existing forecast/prediction tables
   - Not sub-second real-time (acceptable for reporting use case)

3. **Learning Nudge Samples**: Static for v3.2.0
   - Future: Dynamic nudges from `ai_learning_insights` table
   - Current: 3 curated samples cover common patterns

4. **Orchestration Stop**: Does not stop main server
   - Only optional services (cache, daemon)
   - Server restart still requires manual `pkill + node server.js`

5. **Recovery Kit Destination**: Must be writable
   - Falls back to `/tmp` if destination unreachable
   - USB must be mounted at specified path

---

## 🚧 Future Enhancements (Not in v3.2.0)

### Phase 4 (v3.3.0) - Potential Additions
1. **Dynamic Learning Nudges**: Fetch from `ai_learning_insights` table
2. **Report Scheduling**: Email/export reports on cron schedule
3. **Multi-Kit Management**: Track multiple recovery kits with inventory
4. **Orchestration Profiles**: Save/load custom startup sequences
5. **Report Dashboards**: Combine multiple reports into single view
6. **WebSocket Real-Time**: Push updates for orchestration steps
7. **Recovery Auto-Rotation**: Automatic monthly kit creation
8. **Advanced CSV Filters**: Date ranges, item filters for exports
