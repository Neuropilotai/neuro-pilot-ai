## Critical Gaps Requiring Immediate Action

### 1. **Bulk PDF Import** 🔧
- **Impact**: Cannot efficiently migrate 182 existing PDFs from old system
- **Remediation**: Create `POST /api/owner/console/pdfs/bulk-import` endpoint
- **Acceptance**: Successfully import all 182 PDFs with automatic invoice number linking
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 2. **Count Packet Export** 🔧
- **Impact**: Cannot generate printable count sheets with attached PDFs
- **Remediation**: Create `GET /api/owner/console/counts/:id/packet` endpoint
- **Acceptance**: Generate PDF showing count metadata, line items, and linked PDFs
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

### 3. **Session Stability During Counts** 🔧
- **Impact**: Users report logout issues during count editing
- **Remediation**: Review JWT refresh logic, test parallel requests, check CSRF
- **Acceptance**: Complete full count workflow without session loss
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 4. **Views for Reporting** ❌
- **Impact**: Loss of quick reporting queries (v_current_inventory, etc.)
- **Remediation**: Re-create SQLite views or provide equivalent API endpoints
- **Acceptance**: Dashboard shows same metrics as old system
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

### 5. **Data Retention Policy** 🔧
- **Impact**: Database grows unbounded, no cleanup strategy
- **Remediation**: Implement automated archival of old records
- **Acceptance**: Configurable retention per table type
- **Priority**: LOW

---

## Migration Completeness

### ✅ Completed Migrations
- Item master: 1,833 items migrated
- Storage locations: 10 locations migrated
- Field mapping: `description → item_name`, `current_unit_price → unit_cost`, `category_id → category (string)`

### 🔧 Pending Migrations
- PDFs: 182 files at `~/neuro-pilot-ai/backend/data/gfs_orders/` → Bulk import needed
- Credit memos: Assess if table needs migration
- Purchase orders: Assess if table needs migration
- IoT events: Assess if table needs migration
- Database views: Re-create if reporting requires them

## Owner Access Verification

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| **Unrestricted DB Access** | ✅ | Owner role has all permissions |
| **Owner Console Routes** | ✅ | `/api/owner/console/*` protected by `requireOwner` middleware |
| **Location CRUD** | ✅ | Full create, read, update, delete, GPS editing |
| **PDF Management** | ✅ | Upload, list, preview, delete, attach to counts |
| **Count Management** | ✅ | Start, add lines, attach PDFs, close |
| **AI Agent Control** | ✅ | Run all AI commands from Owner Console |
| **2FA Configured** | ✅ | Owner account `neuro.pilot.ai@gmail.com` has 2FA enabled |
| **Session Duration** | ✅ | 1-hour access token, 7-day refresh token |

## Recommendations

### Short-term (Sprint 1)
1. ✅ Complete item and location migration (DONE)
2. 🔧 Implement bulk PDF import endpoint
3. 🔧 Test and fix session stability issues
4. 🔧 Create count packet export

### Medium-term (Sprint 2-3)
1. Re-create reporting views or equivalent APIs
2. Migrate credit memos and purchase orders if needed
3. Implement data retention policies
4. Add comprehensive integration tests

### Long-term (Backlog)
1. IoT events migration (if feature still needed)
2. Enhanced duplicate detection
3. Advanced alert system
4. Custom reporting builder
