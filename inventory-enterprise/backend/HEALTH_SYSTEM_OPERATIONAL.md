# Health System v15.7.0 - OPERATIONAL ✅

**Status:** Fully Operational with Real Data
**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Health Score:** 70/100 (Needs Attention)

---

## Executive Summary

The health monitoring system is **live and operational**, successfully analyzing your production database and identifying real data quality issues. The system has been adapted to work with your actual database schema and is providing actionable insights.

### Current System Health

```
Health Score: 70/100
Status: Needs Attention
Total Issues: 106
Invoices Analyzed: 181
Items in Catalog: 1,864
Items in Stock: 1,864
```

### Key Findings

**106 Invoice Imbalances Detected** (High Priority)
- Line item subtotals don't match reported invoice subtotals
- Examples:
  - Invoice #9027353355: $27,036.17 difference
  - Invoice #9027353360: $4,346.41 difference
  - Invoice #9027353361: $444.72 difference

**Potential Causes:**
1. Missing line items in OCR extraction
2. Additional charges (delivery, fees) not captured
3. Rounding differences in tax calculations
4. Data quality issues in invoice processing

## What's Working

### ✅ API Endpoints (All Operational)

```bash
# Public health check (no auth required)
GET  /api/health/status
→ {"success": true, "status": "operational"}

# Quick health score (auth required)
GET  /api/health/score
→ {"success": true, "health_score": 70, "status": "Needs Attention"}

# Full audit report
GET  /api/health/summary
→ Returns comprehensive report with all metrics

# Issues list
GET  /api/health/issues
→ Returns all detected issues with severity levels

# Low stock items
GET  /api/health/stockouts
→ Returns items below par level

# Cached reports
GET  /api/health/last-report
→ Returns last audit report (faster than running new audit)
```

### ✅ Security & RBAC

- Public endpoints: `/status` (no auth)
- Protected endpoints: OWNER, FINANCE, ADMIN roles
- JWT authentication with device binding
- Structured JSON logging

### ✅ Data Analysis

**Invoice Analysis:**
- 181 invoices processed
- Duplicate detection (0 duplicates found ✅)
- Balance validation (106 imbalances found ⚠️)
- Missing data detection

**Inventory Analysis:**
- 1,864 items in catalog
- Stock level monitoring
- Par level comparisons
- Orphan SKU detection

### ✅ Real-Time Monitoring

- Audit duration: ~30ms (very fast)
- Structured logging to server.log
- Prometheus metrics ready
- Report caching (5-minute TTL)

## Health Checks Implemented

| Check | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Invoice Duplicates** | ✅ Working | Detects duplicate invoices by vendor+number+date |
| **Invoice Balance** | ✅ Working | Validates line items sum to subtotal |
| **Orphan SKUs** | ✅ Working | Finds SKUs in invoices not in item_master |
| **Low Stock** | ✅ Working | Identifies items below par level |
| **Missing Data** | ✅ Working | Detects invoices with missing critical fields |

---

## Schema Adaptation Summary

The health system was successfully adapted from the original design to work with your actual database schema:

### Tables Used

| Original Design | Your Schema | Status |
|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| `invoice_line_items` | `invoice_items` | ✅ Adapted |
| `documents` (invoices) | `processed_invoices` | ✅ Adapted |
| `item_bank` | `item_master` | ✅ Adapted |
| `inventory` (FIFO) | `v_current_inventory` | ✅ Adapted |
| `inventory_usage` | N/A | ⚠️ Skipped (demand analysis) |
| `ai_forecast_daily` | `ai_daily_forecast_cache` | ✅ Available |
| `system_config` | N/A | ⚠️ Skipped (params storage) |

### What Was Adapted

✅ **Invoice Loading**: Changed from `documents` to `processed_invoices`
✅ **Line Items**: Changed from `invoice_line_items` to `invoice_items`
✅ **Items**: Changed from `item_bank` to `item_master`
✅ **Stock**: Changed from `inventory` to `v_current_inventory` view
⚠️ **Demand History**: Skipped (no `inventory_usage` table)
⚠️ **Parameter Storage**: Skipped (no `system_config` table)

## Metrics & Monitoring

### Structured Logging

All health events are logged in JSON format to `server.log`:

```json
{"svc":"health","type":"audit_request","ts":"2025-10-18T09:12:01.881Z","user":"owner@neuropilot.local","endpoint":"summary"}
{"svc":"health","type":"audit_complete","ts":"2025-10-18T09:12:01.915Z","score":70,"status":"Needs Attention","issues":106,"duration_ms":31}
```

### Prometheus Metrics (Ready)

Health metrics are exposed at `/metrics` endpoint:

```
health_score_current{status="Needs Attention"} 70
health_issue_count{type="INVOICE_IMBALANCE"} 106
health_audit_runs_total{mode="read-only",status="success"} 3
health_audit_duration_seconds 0.031
```

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (High Priority)

1. **Investigate Invoice Imbalances**
   - Review top 10 invoices with largest discrepancies
   - Check if OCR is missing line items
   - Verify if additional charges exist (delivery, fees)

2. **Run Full Audit**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $OWNER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"mode":"dry-run"}' \
     http://localhost:8083/api/health/audit/run | jq .
   ```

3. **Review Health Report**
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OWNER_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:8083/api/health/summary > health_report.json
   ```

### Short-Term (This Week)

1. **Set Up Monitoring**
   - Configure Prometheus scraping (optional)
   - Set up daily health check cron job
   - Create alerts for score drops below 75

2. **Data Quality Improvements**
   - Review invoice import process
   - Validate OCR accuracy on sample invoices
   - Document known issues (fees, delivery charges)

3. **Documentation**
   - Document baseline health score (70)
   - Create runbook for handling imbalances
   - Train team on health dashboard

### Long-Term (Next Sprint)

1. **Auto-Fix Implementation**
   - Enable auto-fixes for micro-drift (≤$0.50)
   - Manual approval workflow for larger adjustments
   - Audit trail for all corrections

2. **Enhanced Analytics**
   - Add demand history tracking
   - Implement stockout prediction
   - Price spike detection

3. **Integration**
   - Add health score to owner console dashboard
   - Email alerts for score drops
   - Slack/webhook notifications

## Health Score Bands

| Score | Status | Meaning | Action Required |
|-------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| 90-100 | **Healthy** | System operating normally | Monitor only |
| 75-89 | **Monitor** | Minor issues detected | Review weekly |
| 0-74 | **Needs Attention** | Significant issues | **Immediate action** |

**Current Status: 70/100 (Needs Attention)**

Primary issue: 106 invoice imbalances affecting financial data integrity.

---

## Next Steps

**Option 1: Investigate Imbalances (Recommended)**
```bash
# Get detailed report of all imbalances
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OWNER_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8083/api/health/issues | \
  jq '.data.issues[] | select(.type=="INVOICE_IMBALANCE") | {invoice_no, cents_off, reported_subtotal, calculated_subtotal}' | \
  jq -s 'sort_by(.cents_off | tonumber) | reverse | .[0:10]' > top_imbalances.json
```

**Option 2: Enable Auto-Fixes (After Review)**
```bash
# Run dry-run to see what would be fixed
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OWNER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mode":"dry-run"}' \
  http://localhost:8083/api/health/audit/run
```

**Option 3: Schedule Regular Audits**
```bash
# Add to crontab (daily at 6 AM)
0 6 * * * curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OWNER_TOKEN" http://localhost:8083/api/health/summary > /var/log/health_$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).json
```

sqlite3 db/inventory_enterprise.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM processed_invoices"
sqlite3 db/inventory_enterprise.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoice_items"
```

### Test Endpoints
```bash
# Quick health check
curl http://localhost:8083/api/health/status

# Detailed health (with auth)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OWNER_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8083/api/health/score
```
