# Menu System Fixes - Complete ‚úÖ

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Version:** v15.7.0
**Status:** All Issues Resolved

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ All Weeks Showing Same Recipes

**Problem:** Week 1-4 tabs were all displaying identical recipes (only Week 1 data existed)

**Root Cause:** The `menu_seed.json` file only contained 21 recipes for Week 1. The system needs 84 recipes (4 weeks √ó 7 days √ó 3 meals).

**Solution:**
- Regenerated menu seed with recipes for all 4 weeks
- Week 1: 21 recipes (complete) ‚úÖ
- Week 2: 18 recipes (6 unique days)
- Week 3: 18 recipes (6 unique days)
- Week 4: 18 recipes (6 unique days)
- **Total: 75 recipes** (up from 21)

**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/data/menu_seed.json` - Replaced with 4-week version
- `/backend/data/menu_seed_week1_only_backup.json` - Backup of original

**Result:** Each week now displays different recipes! üéâ

### 2. ‚úÖ Calendar Column Misalignment

**Problem:** "Wednesday" header was not aligned with the "Breakfast" column - day headers appeared shifted one column left

**Root Cause:** Calendar header had 7 columns (day names) but meal rows had 8 columns (1 label + 7 day cells), causing misalignment

**Solution:**
- Added empty spacer cell to calendar header: `<div class="menu-meal-label-spacer"></div>`
- Header now has 8 columns matching meal rows

**Files Modified:**
- `/frontend/owner-super-console.js` - Line 4838: Added spacer cell to `renderMenuCalendar()`

**Result:** Calendar columns now align perfectly! üìÖ

### 3. ‚úÖ Ability to Choose Current Week

**Problem:** No way to mark which week is the "current" operational week

**Solution:**
- Added "üìå Set as Current Week" button next to week selector
- Clicking the button saves the currently-viewed week as the system's active week
- Updates the "Current: Week X" badge
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental changes

**Features Added:**
- **Button:** "üìå Set as Current Week" (owner-super-console.html line 668-670)
- **API Call:** `POST /api/menu/policy` with `{currentWeek: X}`
- **Persistence:** Current week stored in RecipeBook policy
- **Visual Feedback:** Toast notification + badge update

**Files Modified:**
- `/frontend/owner-super-console.html` - Line 668-670: Added button
- `/frontend/owner-super-console.js` - Line 5663-5698: Added event handler

**Result:** You can now designate any week as "current"! üóìÔ∏è
