## 🛠️ Technical Implementation - What Was Fixed

### **Problem 1: Schema Mismatch**
❌ **Before:** Forecast views referenced non-existent `inventory_items` table
✅ **After:** Created `v_current_inventory` helper view using snapshot-based tracking

**Migrations Applied:**
1. `016_current_inventory_helper.sql` - Abstraction layer for snapshot inventory
2. `017_fix_current_inventory_fallback.sql` - Par level fallback when no snapshots
3. `018_fix_forecast_views_schema.sql` - Updated all views to use v_current_inventory

### **Problem 2: Missing Recipe/Menu Tables**
❌ **Before:** No `recipes`, `recipe_ingredients`, or `menu_calendar` tables
✅ **After:** Created full recipe management system with seeded data

**Migration Applied:**
- `019_create_recipe_menu_tables.sql` - Created recipe system with 5 base recipes:
  - STEAK_NIGHT (Saturday recurring, 250 servings)
  - JIGG_DINNER (daily tradition, 250 servings)
  - SANDWICH_DAILY (500 sandwiches baseline)
  - BREAKFAST_SERVICE (250 servings)
  - INDIAN_DAILY (20 servings)

### **Problem 3: Missing Inventory Items**
❌ **Before:** 14 item aliases with no actual items in item_master
✅ **After:** Seeded 33 core food service items with par levels

**Migration Applied:**
- `020_seed_breakfast_beverage_items.sql` - Added:
  - 8 breakfast items (bread, eggs, bacon, ham, bologna, sausage, butter, jam)
  - 6 beverage items (coffee, creamer, milk, tea, OJ, apple juice)
  - 7 sandwich program items (turkey, cheese, lettuce, tomato, condiments)
  - 2 steak night items (AAA steak 10oz, baking potatoes)
  - 8 Indian meal items (basmati rice, spices, chickpeas, lentils, yogurt)

### **Problem 4: Database Library Mismatch**
❌ **Before:** CLI scripts used `better-sqlite3` (not installed)
✅ **After:** All scripts converted to `sqlite3` with proper connection management

**Files Fixed:**
- `MenuPredictor.js` - Added dbRun for INSERT/UPDATE
- `BreakfastPredictor.js` - Added dbRun for INSERT/UPDATE
- All 5 CLI forecast commands in `verify_v4_addons.sh`

## 🧠 AI Learning System

The AI learns from natural language comments:

### **Supported Learning Intents**
```javascript
// Beverage per-person adjustments
"coffee 1.5 cups/person"
"creamer 0.6 oz/cup"

// Breakfast per-person adjustments
"eggs 1.5 per person"
"bacon 2.5 strips/person"

// Recipe quantity adjustments
"500 sandwiches/day"
"steak night 275 servings"

// Population changes
"set population to 275"
"indian population 25"
```

### **Learning Workflow**
1. Owner posts comment → Stored in `ai_feedback_comments`
2. AI parses intent and extracts values
3. Command `--ai-train-feedback` applies changes to profiles
4. Future forecasts automatically use new parameters
5. Accuracy improves over time through reinforcement

## 📈 Predictive Intelligence Features

### **1. Recurring Events** (Automatically Tracked)
- ✅ **Steak Night** - Every Saturday: 10 oz AAA steak × 250 guests
- ✅ **Jigg Dinner** - Daily sliced turkey breast service
- ✅ **Sandwich Program** - 500 sandwiches/day baseline
- ✅ **Indian Meals** - 20 servings daily with specialized spices

### **2. Cultural Meal Split**
- Main population: 230 people (standard menu)
- Indian sub-population: 20 people (specialized menu)
- Separate spice inventory tracking
- AI forecasts both streams independently

### **3. Waste Integration**
- Recipe-based waste: 5% for breakfast, 3% for beverages
- Learning from waste logs adjusts future predictions
- Reduces over-production while preventing stock-outs

### **4. Risk Stratification**
```
🔴 CRITICAL  - Out of stock, immediate action required
🟡 HIGH      - Less than 50% coverage, reorder needed
🟠 MEDIUM    - Less than 100% coverage, monitor
🟢 LOW       - Adequate stock
```

## 🎯 Next Steps to Full Autonomy

### **Phase 1: Data Integration** (Ready Now)
1. ✅ Link recipes to actual ingredients in `recipe_ingredients`
2. ✅ Import 4-week rotating menu into `menu_calendar`
3. ✅ Take first inventory snapshot to populate real stock levels
4. ✅ Verify item_codes match between menu Excel and item_master

### **Phase 2: Continuous Learning** (In Progress)
1. ✅ Daily forecast generation working
2. ⏳ Daily comparison vs actual usage (requires snapshots)
3. ⏳ Accuracy scoring and automated feedback
4. ⏳ Model auto-tuning based on patterns

### **Phase 3: Advanced Forecasting** (Future)
1. ⏳ Weekday vs weekend pattern detection
2. ⏳ Seasonal variance tracking (holiday spikes)
3. ⏳ Weather-based adjustments (hot days → more cold beverages)
4. ⏳ Special event handling (conferences, banquets)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### No forecast items showing?
- **Check:** Are recipes linked to ingredients in `recipe_ingredients`?
- **Fix:** Run SQL to link recipe_code → item_code with quantities

### Stock levels all zero?
- **Check:** Have any inventory snapshots been created?
- **Fix:** System uses par_level as fallback until first physical count

### Breakfast/beverage not forecasting?
- **Check:** Does `site_population` have today's record?
- **Fix:** Run `--set-population 250` to initialize

### CLI commands hanging?
- **Check:** Is sqlite3 npm package installed?
- **Fix:** `npm install sqlite3 --save`
