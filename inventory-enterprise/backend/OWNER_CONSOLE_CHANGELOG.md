3. All tabs load on-demand (no upfront delays)

### Typical Workflows

**Morning Forecast Review:**

2. Forecast → Adjust population if needed
3. AI Console → Review reorder recommendations
4. Inventory → Spot-check critical items

**Month-End Count:**
1. Count → Start new count with location
2. Inventory → Spot-check items (adds to active count)
3. PDFs → Multi-select unprocessed invoices
4. PDFs → "Include in Count" (links to active count)
5. Count → Review process panel (items + PDFs)
6. Count → Close (creates snapshot)

**AI Training:**

2. AI Console → "Submit Feedback"
3. AI Console → "Train Now" to apply immediately
4. Forecast → Refresh to see updated predictions

## Security

- RequireOwner middleware on all backend routes
- Token TTL countdown with automatic logout at 0
- Device binding tracked in localStorage
- No external dependencies or analytics
- Localhost-only (127.0.0.1:8083)
- All API calls include Authorization header
- 401/403 triggers re-auth prompt

## Performance

- Initial load: <1s (M3 Pro)
- Tab switch: <100ms (no re-fetch if data cached)
- Each API call: <300ms
- No heavy frameworks (vanilla JS only)
- Graceful degradation if data missing

## Error Handling

- Empty states for missing data (no crashes)
- API errors show user-friendly messages
- Console.error for debugging without user exposure
- Automatic retry on 401 (re-auth flow)
- Fallback sample data in AI widgets if tables missing

## Testing

Run smoke tests:
```bash
cd /Users/davidmikulis/neuro-pilot-ai/inventory-enterprise/backend
chmod +x test_owner_super_console.sh
./test_owner_super_console.sh
```

Tests all 8 tabs and their data sources with real API calls.

## Notes

- Tab preference saved in localStorage (persists across reloads)
- Warm cache preference saved (optional)
- Token auto-refreshed via middleware (if configured)
- PDF modal supports range requests (fast streaming)
