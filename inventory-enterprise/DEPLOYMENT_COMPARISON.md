## Fast/Minimal Approach

**Files:**
- `server.production-minimal.js` - 200 lines
- `migrations/001_schema.sql` - Core tables
- `migrations/002_roles_and_grants.sql` - DB roles
- `migrations/003_rls_policies.sql` - RLS policies
- `scripts/backup-minimal.sh` - pg_dump + rclone
- `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_PHASED.md` - 3-week guide

### Pros ✅
- **Get to production fast** - 3 weeks from start to live
- **Lower complexity** - Easier to understand and maintain
- **Budget-friendly** - $22-46/month starting cost
- **Proven stack** - Railway + Vercel + Neon + Cloudflare
- **Easy to upgrade** - Can add comprehensive features later

### Cons ❌
- **Basic security** - No GPG encryption, no backup verification
- **Manual processes** - Some operations require manual intervention
- **Limited monitoring** - Basic health checks only
- **No audit trail** - Minimal compliance features

### When to Use

## Migration Path: Fast → Comprehensive

You can start with Fast and upgrade to Comprehensive incrementally:

### Week 1-3: Fast Deployment
```bash
# Deploy minimal stack
./scripts/deploy-minimal.sh
```

### Month 2: Add Backup Verification
```bash
# Upgrade to comprehensive backup system
cp backup/backup-database.sh scripts/
cp backup/test-backup.sh scripts/
./scripts/setup-cron.sh
```

### Month 3: Add Monitoring
```bash
# Add Prometheus metrics
# Setup Grafana dashboards
# Configure alerts
```

### Month 4: Add Security Hardening
```bash
# Switch to server.production.js
# Add GPG encryption
# Enable advanced WAF rules
# Implement audit logging
```

### Month 5: Add Compliance Features
```bash
# Implement data retention policies
# Add user consent tracking
# Setup compliance reporting
# Document security controls
```

**Total Migration Cost:** ~1-2 hours/week for 5 months
